IBM offers a Prompt Lab to create, organize and share prompts. Users are able to control prompt level parameters. The watsonx.ai IDE for Gen AI is the Prompt Lab.  The Prompt Lab makes it easy to perform prompt tuning by providing a structured prompt tunning template, a free-form template and also a Jupyter notebook environment.  Users can also access the environment from the command line or through other IDE's such as VS Code or PyCharm. The Prompt Lab mentioned above enables users to experiment with and save prompt tuning sessions. The watsonx.ai platform fully supports the RAG pattern and there are tutorials and sample code available to accelerate developers working on this use case. watsonx.ai can be integrated with conversational system such as IBM's watsonx Assistant and others.  The Watsonx.ai SDK and API's support integration with vector databases.  Both prompt analytics and performance monitoring are supported with watsonx.governance.  Prompt engineers and validators can automatically monitor and evaluate LLMs for quality and safety metrics. This improves prompt quality and ensures models do not need babysitting, as data scientists are alerted for any thresholds breached. Includes metrics for LLM quality, drift, and monitoring of toxicity and PII for both the LLM output and user input.
