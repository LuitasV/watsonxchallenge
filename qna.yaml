  - question: |
      Analysis of technical vulnerabilities of the product, and remediating all the critical vulnerabilities prior to
      their release to production.
    answer: |
      All involved parts of the solution are scanned regularly for known vulnerabilities, using multiple third-party
      scanning tools. Each of the Critical and High vulnerabilities are analyzed and assessed. Those that are assessed
      to have an impact are fixed. All released software parts are free of critical or high.
  - question: How often is scanning performed?
    answer: |
      All involved parts of the solution are scanned for new vulnerabilities daily.
  - question: Does IBM perform independent Pen Tests before publishing to production?
    answer: |
      Penetration tests on IBM Cloud on which watsonx.ai aaS is hosted & more are done regularly as mentioned here:
      https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-security. Critical and high vulnerabilities are addressed
      before releasing.
  - question: How are vulnerabilities remediated?
    answer: |
      Vulnerabilities identified as a result of technical vulnerability tests and / or penetration tests must be
      remedied based on the following parameters: * Emergency: As soon as possible * Critical: 30 days * Medium:
      90 days * Low: With a risk-based approach Emergency vulnerabilities are handled as quickly as possible via an
      exception process. Both critical and major vulnerabilities are resolved within a week. Medium vulnerabilities
      are remediated within 90 days, low vulnerabilities are addressed based on the risk they pose.
  - question: How often are security patches made available.
    answer: |
      New security patches available must be checked at least once a week. Vulnerability scanning happens daily, with
      CVE libraries within the scanners updated continuously.
  - question: Does the product/platform provide an easy to use integrated Model Registry?
    answer: |
      We deliver models through docker registry.
  - question: Does the Model Registry have any restrictions on Model size & parameters?
